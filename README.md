# bfhl_api
The BFHL REST API project is a web-based interface designed to process and respond to specific HTTP requests. The primary objective of this project was to accept GET and POST requests, segregate incoming data into numbers and alphabets, and determine the highest alphabet based on its position in the A-Z series.
